#Code Generator of Model-View-Controller for java Struts 2. #

Given as input a db schema it returs the code of model-view-controller of a system to create, update, delete and report the entitites in the data base. 

The system is designed to help fast software development allowing the developer to edit the code in a very versatile way, since all the queries and code is generated to be edited by professional programmers. 

It is very easy to design the database of a system using diagram such as workbench of mysql and later to use this software to generate the code. The project started as generation of php code so you will see some past code inside the java code generator. I made this project just for fun in my free time in 2015, for sure it can be improved. 
I will work on it when i have time. Feel free to collaborate this software could be adapted and used for another framework or language.

Thank you 
Luis Angel Montiel Moreno.
